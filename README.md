# c00lgui-for-Minecraft-Fabric-
A private Minecraft 1.21.5 mod made with Fabric that adds a GUI-based hack menu with features like X-ray, Nuker, Fly, and more.

Only the username `T3levisionTV` has full access. Others are restricted or blocked. In some cases, people that I TRUST with t0idgui/c00lgui has full/some access.

`IMPORTANT` c00lgui has NOT been fully released and the origional zip file is in error. The .jar file has not been released because I have to install gradle.

# Note
This is my very first project so PLEASE expect errors from this. It is still in its alpha.
